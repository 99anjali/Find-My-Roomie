## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)

 Since it is a 40 point task do read and fulfil the MDC accordingly.

- There should be a login/Sign up screen along with minimum 2 other screens.
- The onboarding screens must look like onboarding screens and not like any other screens of the app.
- The screens should follow a common theme i.e. they should be colour matched and have proper illustrations and images if you are planning to add them
- The written content on the screens should be short but convincing. If not done currently, it is the onboarding screens that constitute to the drop-off rates in apps.
- It should explain the basic purpose of the app along with convincing the user that the app is worth their time.
