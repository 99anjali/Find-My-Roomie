# Find My Roomie 👬 App Design

For developing an app, it is essential to know the importance of UI/UX in the mobile app📱. You can create an app with great functionality but if you fail to focus on the designing part, it may lead to the downfall of your app. It is mandatory to have the right balance between the functionality and UI/UX of the app in order to make it a successful one✅. Do you have what it takes?

## 🧾Common Rules:

- The repository is divided into several tasks. **Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only.** NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific folders.
- The submissions will be judged by the mentors and points will be allotted by them for each particular task based on various aspects and intricacies of design like design thinking process, originality of the idea, visual appeal of the submission, etc.

Since everyone should be awarded for their efforts, the participants who qualify for the **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)** as mentioned in the respective folders of the task will be awarded Full Points🎉
