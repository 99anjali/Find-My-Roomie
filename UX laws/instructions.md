OPEN TO ALL
FIRST COME FIRST SERVE (Read submission guideline)

Are you enjoying your work as a UX designer, probably first time in your life thinking about things from users' point of view. Now lets get all theoretical, but don't worry UX is all about user experience so even the basic theory required for this task can be skimmed through in 10 minutes ðŸ’ƒ. 

Visit this site [https://lawsofux.com/](https://lawsofux.com/) and try to skim through some of the laws of the UX, no need to read all of them only reading few will be enough for this task.

Since this website is dedicated to the Laws of UX then they must have been heavily applied within this websiteðŸ¤”. Your task is to identify 3 such UX laws that have come into play on this very websiteðŸŽ¯. Elaborate on how the laws have been applied or are coming into play. Present your thoughts in any format that seems appropriate to you. YOU MUST include screenshots of the section where you feel the laws have been used and explain how the laws have been applied. Go be lawyers of UX!ðŸ˜Ž

<br>

## Submission Guideline:

Submit your ideas along with screenshots in google doc and provide the link to the doc in a .txt file.

Pay Attention: If somebody has already identified a UX law in some particular section, you CANNOT submit the same idea again. Either identify some other principle or some other section where the same law has been applied!
Be quick! Even though it is open to all, this issue is FIRST COME FIRST SERVE.
