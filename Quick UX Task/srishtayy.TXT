My opinion on Whatsapp

1) I believe that the layout of whatsapp is such that it allows user to view things quite efficiently.For example
    we have status ,calls and chats placed together so that we can easily move from one to the other.

   This feature saves lot of time and also allows us to view easily else  it would have taken a lot of time and craeted difficulties
   for user if placed somewhere else.

2) The search button on the top right corner is also positioned well as it can be viewed easily being on top of the screen.
   Had it been somewhere at the bottom we might not have bothered much about using it or would have ignored it.
  
3) Also the feature displaying number of  messages in green at right side of every chat enhances user experience and makes
  it easier to view things thereby helping the user.

Suggestions:
  
1) Like we have separate colours for contact names for different contacts in a whatsapp group we could also have separate colour
   for chatbox or seperate color for the chats done by different users in order to view things even more efficiently. 

2) Message reactions could be a great feature to enhance user experience like you have on instagram.
   Instead of tagging the messages unnecessarily just to send an emoji we can have message reactions.
