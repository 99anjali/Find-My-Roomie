My opinion on Whatsapp

1) I believe that the layout of whatsapp is such that it allows user to view things quite efficiently.For example
    we have status ,calls and chats placed together so that we can easily move from one to the other.

   This feature saves lot of time and also allows us to view easily else  it would have taken a lot of time and created difficulties
   for user if placed somewhere else.

2) The search button on the top right corner is also positioned well according to Jacob's law of UX which states that users prefer 
   your website to function similarly to the websites they visit on regular basis. That means
  that important elements on your website should behave as similar as possible to elements on other websites that the 
  user visits regularly.An example can be the search button on the top most like a company logo on a website which allows user to 
  search groups easily saving lot of time.
  
3) Also the feature displaying crucial parts like calls ,status ,search option and the feature of creating new group are positioned 
   accurately on the top and bottom respectively as  we tend to remember best the first and the last items in that list or sequence
   (serial position effect) like we have in most of the websites.
