Opinions on WhatsApp Home Screen

Reviews:

1. Users can distinguish which chats have new messages or which chats haven't been read yet. The set of colours used by WhatsApp, white and green makes it possible. Also, this set of colours provides a rather comfortable view to the human eye.
2. The most used features are there on the home screen making navigation easier and faster for the users. Users instantly get all the updates at a glance.
3. Pin and archive chats feature that help users to stick to their priorities. If this feature wasn't there, users would have to go through all the messages all the time to see which ones are the most urgent. That would have been time consuming.
4. It has simple yet effective UX such that new users can easily process and understand its working. This design is resposible for the huge user base that WhatsApp has today.
5. The feature that indicates in which groups have the user been mentioned helps them to go through relatively important chats first. This helps users keep updated with their chats even when busy.


Suggestions to improve User Experience:

1. Remove archived chats from the home screen. It can be included in the lesser visited areas of the app.
2. Increase the maximum number of chats that can be pinned at a time.
3. Create different sections for direct messages and group chats. Since group chats are less important than direct messages, keep direct messages section as the primary screen. However, make a feature so that important group chats can be pinned on the primary screen.
