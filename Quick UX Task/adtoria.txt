Opinions on WhatsApp Home Screen

WhatsApp, almost everyone will agree, is closest to perfection. Its easy to use UI design makes it distinguish itself from others.

According to me, the best features of WhatsApp Home Screen are:

1. Its good-looking, homely and neat UI which contains minimum yet sufficient features.
2. It is customizable, be it our all-time favourite dark mode or the font-size of names of contacts.
3. The broadcast messaging feature.
4. Pin and archive chats feature.


Suggestions to improve User Experience:

1. Increase in maximum number of chats that can be pinned at the same time.
2. A feature to choose whether or not to show group chat history to newly added members.
3. Removing archived chats from the home screen. It can be included in the frequently visited areas of the app.
