Whatsapp reviews 
Chats section covers a significant area of the screen because of its very frequent usage.
Pinned messages always come at the top of the screen - 
Since we pin the chats which are very important to us, therefore, it’s very helpful to see those chats at the top. 
If the pinned messages didn’t come on the topic then they will go under the less important messages hence it would be 
difficult for us as we may end up missing the pinned messages (important) and not replying on time.

Whatsapp Suggestions -
The status section of the app has wide spaces on the right side of the screen, also the left section where status is displayed has a very simple design - 
The status section should be made more creative by adding a comment in the right to show whether you reacted to status or not and the theme of that section must be changed.
