WhatsApp UI Cool Features:

1. Archived Chats
	Helps keep the homescreen minimal, avoids clutter by keeping all non-important chats in a separate folder out of the user's view.
	If this feature did not exist, we would be overwhelmed by the number of chats in the homescreen.

2. Latest chat on top
	Helps us access the latest messages.
	If this feature did not exist, we would be searching for all our latest messages throughout the homescreen.
	
3. Chat pinning
	Helps us pin 3 chats on top so that they are always the ones on the top of homescreen whether or not there are new messages.
	If this feature did not exist, we would lose track of important conversations such as the ones with family members.
	
SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE USER EXPERIENCE
	The number of chats that the user can pin should be increased because it is possible that one has more than 3 important conversations that 		they might want to keep on top.
